# Cab Booking Demand Prediction ðŸš•ðŸ“Š  
Predicting cab demand based on historical booking data and weather conditions.

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project analyzes how factors like temperature, humidity, and time influence cab bookings. It uses **machine learning** to predict future demand.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack  
âœ… Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)  
âœ… Machine Learning (Regression, Feature Engineering)  
âœ… Data Visualization (Seaborn, Matplotlib)  
âœ… Deployment (Streamlit, Docker)  

## ðŸ“Š Dataset  
The dataset includes **cab booking data**, weather conditions, and time-based features.  

- `train.csv` â†’ Historical bookings  
- `train_label.csv` â†’ Labels (Total Bookings)  
- `test.csv` â†’ Test data  
- `test_label.csv` â†’ Test labels  

## ðŸš€ How to Run  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/data_preprocessing.py
python src/model_training.py
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Results  
âœ… Identified key factors affecting cab demand.  
âœ… Cleaned dataset and removed outliers.  
âœ… Built a predictive model for demand forecasting.
